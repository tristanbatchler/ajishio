# Platformer

This is a simple platformer game demonstrating the use of the [LDtk](https://ldtk.io) level editor 
with Ajishio.

The game makes use of LDtk's [Super simple export](https://ldtk.io/docs/super-simple-export) feature 
which is easiest to integrate with Ajishio.

It also demonstrates the use of Aseprite sprites with Ajishio. More information on how to load 
sprites can be found [in the project's README](/README.md#loading-sprites).
